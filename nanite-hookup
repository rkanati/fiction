Nanite Hookup
==============

---

How long have I been lying here? A few minutes? An hour? She said she'd be back soon. The ceiling is blurred through my reddened eyes, the bed soaked with sweat. My sweat. I can smell it. I realise I'm actually breathing.

---

I'm exhausted, after an evening of preparation. Our mutual friends had taken my obvious desperation as permission, and set up our meeting. They'd told her a lot about me, and she'd made me tell her the rest.

I was sure I'd say something too pathetic, too shameful, and she'd throw me back out into my misery. But after every confession, every tragic little tale I told, even the ones that crumpled me into a screaming heap, she'd soothed me with a calm smile. None of it was new to her.

---

My eyes and throat had burned as she pulled it all out of me. I used to hate those sensations, how they drained me, how they threatened to suffocate me. But she'd taught me they could be cleansing, freeing. An hour in, and they'd started to feel cathartic. I wanted more.

---

Another breath, a little easier. It's dark outside now, the only light coming from the bedside lamp. I venture a look down the bed. Still naked, still sore after she'd made me strip down and shower under her supervision.

She'd made sure I scrubbed every inch of myself raw, scrubbed away all the layers of dirt and shame and fear. Unsatisfied, she'd taken the sponge from me, scrubbing so hard that it hurt. I'd cried again.

---

Those had been my last tears. Quiet ones, after the burning, howling ones I'd given her earlier. And after, she'd taken me into her cool hands, satisfied that I was finally ready.

All the years of self-loathing boiled down into a few hours of anguish, wept into tissues or washed down the drain. I felt safe. I think she liked what remained of me.

---

I hear footsteps from behind the door; her footsteps. My heart skips a beat, and I have to squirm slightly to stay calm. She steps into the room, locking the door behind her, and paces towards the bed.

She seems relaxed now, even casual, clearly at-ease with what is left of me after her work. There's a dark shape, like a ring box, clutched in her left hand.

---

She sits cross-legged on the bed just behind me, and scoots closer, lifting my head into her lap. Warmth. Her cool hands again, now on my head, which before were deft, clinical, are now gentle, even loving. She is beaming down at me, and I realize I'm smiling back.

---

"Feeling better?" Her intonation is teasing, even playful. I'm giddy. I manage a few little nods in response. Her face breaks into a grin. She enjoys this part. She turns to her side for a moment, and I hear the box click open. She takes something out, and holds it over my head.

---

It's what I've been waiting for. It's everything I've ever wanted, even before I knew it was possible, even before I could conceive of it.

---

The ampoule is slightly shorter than her little finger, clear glass holding a tiny reservoir of shimmering gold liquid, sparkling in the lamplight, a plastic cap at one end. I stare up at it in awe.

Intricate patterns form in the liquid, spread, and fade over a few moments. A suspension of trillions upon trillions of nanites - tiny machines that can tear apart a person and rearrange them into any form.

---

"Please," I manage weakly, "Please, make me into something better".

I have surrendered to her completely now, and for a few moments, she remains still, revelling in it. Wordlessly, she pulls the cap from the ampoule, exposing a tiny, stubby needle.

---

I realize her smile has changed - sharper, tinged with her own hunger. I feel her legs tense slightly. They'd told me that, in lieu of payment, she demanded some say in the final form of her guests. I hadn't understood what they meant. I think I do now. Warmth behind my head.

---

With her free hand, she reaches for a swab from the box by the lamp. Only a few seconds left to wait, and I can feel myself start to panic. I shut my eyes tight and try to breath steadily.

The smell of alcohol, then cool wetness on my neck. My mind races with all the beautiful shapes she might make me into. My heart is pounding in my head.

---

I can feel her warm breath on my face. She kisses me.

Whatever she wants from me, she can have.

---

The needle pricks my neck, and it all stops. All that's left is the sting as she presses it into me, and a scratching, crawling sensation, spreading out like ants.

---

It's really happening. It's finally too late. I can't go back, and I don't want to. It's started.

I hope it hurts.
